 recommended use for a three layer filament print from opaque to translucent to opaque.
 This achieves an edge lit stained glass look, this print has been prone to separation layer from layer.
 I printed this with no supports and long bridging 
 can make fit very tight but cleaning up with exact o knife gave me best results removing supports from inside case didnâ€™t work well for me.
 I included the gcode for this one to show how where Ive changed layers colors.

How to:

Tested on Ender3v2 with HatchBox Translucent PLA Prusa Silcer)

Printed Key_Chain_USB_A_Port
Hot glue port inside of Print less is more 1/2 pull on trigger with hot glue to avoid spilling into port.

Printed Detector Case
       CATION I've tried to make this a good fit ie down side the boot button on side is prone to breaking when installing and Underside of LED makes fit tight!CATION!
Hot glue placed on back of female port to seal off from dust used tape to cover port.
 Printing my V5 gcode can give you the edge lit look but offers a substantially weaker case due  to layer direction.
Plug_Cap
       Hot glue port inside of cap.
 

I hope someone finds this project as fun and useful as I did!

I'm gonna plan on revisiting this project after some testing.
